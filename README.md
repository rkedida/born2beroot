## Introduction
The Born2beRoot project is a great opportunity to dive into system administration and virtualization,

offering an intensive and hands-on approach to these topics. 

## The key learnings and benefits I got from this exercise can be summarized as follows:

### 1. Understanding of Virtualization:
The exercise introduced me to the fascinating world of virtualization. By setting up my own machine on VirtualBox,

I learned how to create and manage a virtual environment, gaining practical insights into the application of virtualization in modern computing.

### 2. Operating System Installation and Configuration:
I was able to set up my own operating system while enforcing strict rules.

This exercise deepened my understanding of OS configuration and the management of services,

as well as providing experience in setting up and maintaining a server.

### 3. System Administration:
The project enabled me to gain hands-on experience in system administration.

This includes user and permissions management, installation and configuration of necessary services,

and system monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 4. Security:
The project underscored the importance of strong security measures in system administration.

I learned about secure SSH configuration, strong password policies, and the use of firewalls

to protect system resources.

I also gained an understanding of encryption through the creation of encrypted partitions.

### 5. Scripting:
Developing the monitoring.sh script gave me valuable experience in bash scripting.

This script not only monitors and reports system status, but also enhanced my understanding 

of how different system components interact and how to programmatically access this information.
